## Uses
* GGally contains several functions for creating different plotting matrices

* Useful for univariate and bivariate analysis

* ggpairs does three things in one line of code

  * Scatterplot specific variables to examine for correlation

  * Creates a distribution graph for single variables

  * Tests for correlation

## Univariate analysis

* Needed to determine distribution of variables

* Allows researcher to do proper analysis

  * Basic univariate analysis procedure is to plot a histogram
  
  * Other things to look at are summary statistics such as mean, median, IQR, etc.


## Univariate analysis (continued)  
```{r hist, echo=TRUE}
hist(mtcars$mpg, main="mtcars MPG distribution",
     xlab="Miles per Gallon")
#Shows this variable is slightly skewed, but probably normal enough
```


## Bivariate analysis
* May want to test for correlation 
  * Base R can do a test of correlation
  
```{r corr, echo=TRUE}
cor.test(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$disp)
```
## Bivariate analysis (continued)
```{r singlescatter, echo=TRUE}
plot(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$disp,xlab="Miles per Gallon",
     ylab="Displacement (cu.in.)",
     main="Relating MPG to Displacement in mtcars dataset")
```

## Trying to plot full dataset using base R
```{r fullplot, echo=TRUE}
plot(mtcars[-c(2,8:11)])
```



## Using the ggpairs function
* ggpairs in GGally package combines 3 needs

  * Creates the same scatter plots as base R without flipping y axis
  
  * Shows a distribution graph of single variable
  
  * Performs a test of correlation between intersecting variables in matrix
  
## Using the ggpairs function (continued)
```{r GGally, echo = TRUE}
ggpairs(mtcars[-c(2,8:11)])
# mtcars[-c(2,8:11)] are the quant. continuous variables in mtcars
```
