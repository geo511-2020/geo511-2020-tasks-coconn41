 Functions that I find especially useful:
 Any of the join functions are especially useful. I have used them before when working with very messy relational data. These functions make it easy to decide what you want to join based on, what variables you want to keep, etc.
Another obvious function that is useful is the filter function. Prior to using this funciton, I was using the subset function from base R.
Compared to the subset function, filter makes things especially easy, and can be used in combination of other dplyr functions while piping.
