 Some functions from the reading that I have found particularly useful:
 I have not used these functions yet, but they seem to be important when making maps to display spatial information
 -st_point, st_linestring, st_polygon all seem to be important when designing theoretical representations of specific spatial areas.
 Although the above may be useful for creating maps from scratch, this seems to be not something most people do frequently. 
 Another important function seems to be the st_crs call, this call returns either the EPSG code or the proj4string call, which is useful for determining a coordinate reference system.
Further, the st_set_crs call is useful for setting CRS's when making maps (and doing analysis)
Although this is all new for me at this point, I look forward to learning it. I am used to using ArcMap, but R seems so much more intuiative and reproducible.
